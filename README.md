</p>

**Contributing to this repo will count against one of the PRs for HacktoberFest2020 only if submitted between 1<sup>st</sup> October and 31<sup>st</sup> October.**

**Please refer to _CONTRIBUTING.md_ for the same.**

**The following problems need solutions as on date 4<sup>th</sup> Oct, 2020**

<ol>
<li> WAP to find area of a circle, a rectangle and a triangle, using concept of function overloading.</li>
  <li> WAP to find volume of a sphere, a cylinder and a cuboid, using function overloading.</li>
<li>WAP which displays a given character, n number of times, using a function. When the n value is not provided, it should print the given character 80 times. When both the character and n value is not provided, it should print ‚Äò*‚Äô character 80 times. Write the above program in two ways:-
  <ul>
  <li>using function overloading.</li>
  <li>using default arguments</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li> WAP to find square and cube of a number using inline function.</li>
<li> WAP to increment the value of an argument given to function USINGINLINE function.</li>
<li> Write a program to create a class called COMPLEX and implement the following overloading functions ADD that return a COMPLEX number.
  <ul>
  <li>ADD (a , s2) - where a is an integer (real part) and s2 is a complex number.</li>
  <li>ADD (s1, s2) - where s1 and s2 are complex numbers.</li>
  </ul>
  
<li> Write a program to demonstrate the concept of call-by-value, call-by-reference &amp;
call-by address by taking swapping of two numbers as an example. </li>
<li> Write a program to demonstrate the use of scope resolution operator(::) by
declaring same variable name globally and locally and display the value of global and
local variables. </li>
<li> Create a class ‚Äòshape‚Äô. Derive three classes from it: Circle, Triangle and Rectangle. Include the relevant data members and functions in all the classes. Find the area of each
shape and display it. </li>
<li> Create a class which stores employee name,id and salary Derive two classes from
‚ÄòEmployee‚Äô class: ‚ÄòRegular‚Äô and ‚ÄòPart-Time‚Äô. The ‚ÄòRegular‚Äô class stores DA, HRA and
basic salary. The ‚ÄòPart-Time‚Äô class stores the number of hours and pay. </li>
<li>.Write a program to find out the greatest between two numbers defined in two
different classes by using friend function</li>
</ol>

## üèÅ Getting Started

Clone the repo and run in the directory
```
g++ main.cpp -o main.out && ./main.out
```

## üéà Usage

- The interface of the menu is fairly simple, you just have to enter the number, which is against the function you wish to run and then follow the instructions displayed.

## ‚ùó Issues
If you find any bugs, please create an issue. We will work towards resolving it as fast as we can.
